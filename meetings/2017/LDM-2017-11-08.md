# C# Language Design Notes for Nov 8, 2017

***Warning: These are raw notes, and still need to be cleaned up. Read at your own peril!***


# Constructors

Currently the prototype doesn't look for `this(...)` constructor initializers. It should, and exempt constructors that do that. 

We may consider a more nifty analysis later, at least for private constructors, but it doesn't seem high priority.

It's a warning per constructor. If it's on the implicit (default) constructor it goes on the class name. That's good.


## struct initialization

We don't warn for the default constructor on structs. It's not really actionable, we think. But this is worth revisiting later, probably in the context of Xtreme mode. 


# Dotted names

Now work in the prototype, modulo a few bugs. (Not fully handling reassignment).


# Default expressions

Should `default(string)` be of type `string?` or should it yield a warning *in and of itself*, and be of the type `string` (the type it states).

This is a question that's related to whether `string s = null` as a local declaration yields a warning. 

We're going to leave the current impl, which makes `default(string)` be a `string?`.

Similar with `(string)null`. It's type is `string?`.


# Should we track null state for nonnullable ref types?

Not now. Worth thinking about for later, as a stop gap.

# Inferred types for method type inference

Best type and method type inference, don't pick up inferred nullability, but only declared nullability

``` c#
void M(string? s)
{
    if (s == null) return;
    var a = new[] { s }; // string?[], should be string[]
}
```

There's a design question what is inferred when types differ only by nullability of type arguments


# Inferred nullability in hover tips

Currently shows declared nullability. Relatively big work item, won't be fixed in prototype. So we need to set expectations. 

The squiggle is the bottom line. :-D


# Smaller things not yet done

Some warnings not given: That's alright, we'll give more in the future.
New constraints (`class?`, `object`): Not blocking
Variance: we'll deal with it when we get there.


# Unconstrained generics

Need to revisit to see if the weirdness we do is the right weirdness. Doesn't have to be consistent with the rest of the language.


# Other issues

- No switch in the prototype. Need to design the command line switch
- Annotations for TryGet etc.
- How to update BCL with annotations (automatically?)
