# C# Language Design Notes for Nov 27, 2017

***Warning: These are raw notes, and still need to be cleaned up. Read at your own peril!***



## Agenda

We went over the feedback on the nullable reference types prototype, and discussed how to address the top issues that people had found using the feature on their own source code.

1. Interacting with existing, unannotated APIs
2. Accommodating alternative initialization patterns
3. Tracking nullable value types
4. Tracking dotted names
5. Special methods
6. Filtering out nulls
